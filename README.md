Display the output that is given from ESP32-CAM using web server.

The components we will need to build these parts are:

- ESP32 CAM
- FTDI programmer
- Jumper wires

#  ESP32 Camera
The ESP32 camera is a powerful, versatile microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems, renowned for its dual-core processing, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, and a rich array of GPIO pins, making it a preferred choice for a wide range of IoT applications. Its dual-core architecture allows for simultaneous execution of tasks, enabling efficient handling of complex operations.

# FTDI Module
The FTDI module is also known as the (Future Technology Devices International) module.
It is often used for USB to serial communication, typically features a pinout that includes:

- RXD (Receive Data): This is where data is received by the FTDI chip from an external device.
- TXD (Transmit Data): Data to be transmitted from the FTDI chip to an external device is sent out through this pin.
- CTS (Clear to Send): Also related to hardware flow control, this pin indicates to the FTDI chip that the external device is ready to receive data.
- DTR (Data Terminal Ready): This pin is often used to reset or control an external device.
- 5V or 3.3V: Depending on the module, it provides either a 5-volt or 3.3-volt power output.
- GND (Ground): The ground pin provides the reference voltage for the module.
